# TheMachisGame
Last one to pick the matchstick loses the game.

**The algorithm works on delicate handler methods and synchronization.**

In this app, you're have to pick matchsticks. Whoever picks the last matchstick loses the game. Multithreading is achieved with synchronization so that only one player is allowed to pick the matchstick(s) while avoiding deadlock!
The code can handle any exception and App Not Responding errors without compromising with the user experience.
